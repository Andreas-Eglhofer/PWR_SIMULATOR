# Context
During my research at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, I gained a lot of coding abilities that made me want to create a software project for web development. I thought that I could apply the skills by undertaking a project for the physics instructors at GSSM (shoutout to Dr. Bain), for both GSSM students and students around the world, and for the general people of Hartsville and the citizens as an act of giving back and doing something positive with the learning that I had done. Nuclear energy is, in my opinion, the future and a great invention that still needs a lot of development to unlock its full potential. Researching the different aspects of a power plant and a reactor allowed me to learn more, which I am forever grateful for. Mentorship of the fellow interns, graduate, doctoral, post-doctoral students as well as my own the mentors working at the institute have changed me for the better, and I will always be in gratitude.
# PWR Simulator
PWR Simulator is an interactive, web-based learning program that mimics the operation of a pressurized water nuclear reactor (PWR). Users can experiment with real-time control of reactor parameters and see the effect on core power, temperature, and reactivity immediately.
**It does the following:**
Mimics realistic nuclear reactor physics in a safe, convenient environment
Enables users to explore the effect of operating choices, including emergency shutdowns (SCRAM)
Provides real-time data visualization and feedback
Provides explicit victory and meltdown conditions for experimentation, learning, and enjoyment
## Objectives of the Simulator
Maintain reactor stability through the careful management of power output and core temperature
Avoid a meltdown by keeping the reactor operating within safety limits
Optimize power generation for efficiency
Be victorious by achieving the desired energy output in as short a time as possible while not causing a meltdown
## Reactor Mechanics
Control rods are the principal method of regulating the reactor:
The more nearly 100% inserted, the more safe the reactor, but power output falls
The more the rods are withdrawn, the more power is generated, but instability and risk of meltdown increase
The players must constantly make real time adjustments adding to excitement and mimicing real life experiences
**Project Goals:**
Present challenging nuclear reactor concepts to students and the public in a clear way
Encourage hands-on exploration and independent learning in STEM
Enable outreach and learning programs by providing a free, open, and engaging resource
Show the importance of technical problem-solving and research to create useful tools
Just creating a cool little project for my enjoyment :)
# Final Thoughts
This project was done to combine technical skill, scientific curiosity, and the imperative to be a member of the larger learning community. It was a way for me to experimentally learn difficult concepts. The simulator is solely browser-based.

I hope you enjoy!!!
